                [Filter(6)] <- Second to last level: Data breakdown (by sex, by age, etc)
                [Filter(7)] <- Last level: Point (actual data)

            ** Display properties **
                [Text("Visible Text", "en-ca/fr-ca")] <- This text will be show alongside wherever the contents appear. (Directed by [ShowOn(...)])
                [ShowOn(TextAppearance.Filter)] <- Implicitly applied when using [Filter(...)], do not use
                [ShowOn(TextAppearance.MeasureDescription)] <- Appears in measure description tables
                [ShowOn(TextAppearance.Notes)] <- Appears in the notes section in the data tool
