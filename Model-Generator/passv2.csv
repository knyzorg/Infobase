Sedentary time is determined using a movement intensity cut-point that is theoretically equivalent to < 2 metabolic equivalents (METs). The metabolic equivalent (MET) is a value of metabolic energy cost expressed as a multiple of the resting metabolic rate with 1 MET representing a body at rest. Average daily sedentary time was calculated by summing time spent sedentary on all valid days, and dividing by the number of valid days for each respondent. The variable AMMDXSA is used to measure sedentary time.","Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS), Statistics Canada","Sex, age group (5 year, life course), highest level of education (household, respondent), household income, Indigenous (Aboriginal) status, immigrant status, and trend (age-standardized)",Population aged 18 to 79 years,"Statistics Canada derived variable AMMDXSA was used to calculate this indicator for adults aged 18 to 79 years.
